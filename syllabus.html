         <p>In ecological analysis, the edge is a space of transition and definition. Rather than a delineation, it is a space that is occupied and alive. In applying ecological principles to landscape planning and design, Richard Forman identified the edge not as a static line but rather something that is ever changing, a place where systems align, overlap, or are juxtaposed. Otherwise known as the ecotone, this place where ecosystems (both urban and “natural”) meet each other functions as a third system that contains elements of the adjacent systems but with its own independent energies born from those conditions. Thus ecology thrives on diversity; but diversity often also leads to instability.</p>

         <p>The edge can also describe the plight of marginalized communities. In the United States, minority and immigrant populations in urban areas are often economically, physically, and socially isolated. The research on how these neighborhoods will be affected by climate change is still emerging, but the history of environmental injustice is foreboding.</p>

         <p>This year-long research studio interrogates the intertwined issues of social justice and climate change by analyzing the landscapes, communities, and histories of East Boston as a nearby example of where issues of equity and environment intersect. East Boston is subject to frequent flooding, on the edge of an industrial district and adjacent to Logan Airport. Its mean income is one of the lowest in Boston, but as the social and economic landscape of the city changes, its residents have justified concerns about its gentrification.</p>

         <p>East Boston has been identified as a key location of defense in the Resilient Boston Harbor Vision plan, in part because it is home to Constitution Beach, a thin but well-utilized public human-made shoreline park, and Belle Isle Marsh, the last remaining salt marsh in Boston. It is also the home of Suffolk Downs, a 110-acre former horse-racing track on the brink of redevelopment, and Chelsea Creek, the site of an intense battle over the energy and climate future of the neighborhood. Change is imminent in East Boston, either due to sea level rise or development.</p>

         <p>What we are asking you to do this year is to uncover and make visible layers of the built environment, understand stakeholder needs, and ask critical questions so that you can design new platforms for public engagement as well as interpret and visualize urban data. The results of your research should have spatial implications, but ultimately we are more interested in how you synthesize the breadth of your education thus far to construct new lenses on the conceptions of sustainability and resilience.</p>

      <div class="block">
         <h5>Aims and Objectives</h5>
         <p>Each student will develop an individual project sited within East Boston that addresses the issues they initially identified in the fall semester while also adhering to the practices and principles of interpretive planning and design engaged in this spring course. The final project will aim to translate your analysis of social and environmental justice in the city through a physical form and through a digital form. As such, parts of the course will be spent in media workshops where you will learn to use the tools of digital representation to interpret and communicate information gleaned through research and design.</p>

         <p>By the end of the course you should be able to:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>Understand the core theories and approaches relevant to interpretive planning and design.</li>
            <li>Identify and define broad issues affecting interpretive planning and design.</li>
            <li>Analyze existing sites through primary-source spatial research by analyzing written documents, maps and plans, photographs, films, and extant buildings and landscapes.</li>
            <li>Interpret the cultural and historical significance of sites using evidence-based research.</li>
            <li>Identify an audience to whom the interpretive analysis will be addressed.</li>
            <li>Explain the determined significance of sites to this specific and chosen audience.</li>
            <li>Propose design interventions that serve to critically conserve aspects of culture, history, identity, environment, or memory.</li>
            <li>Use the tools of digital media (such as web design, digital mapping, and data visualization) to communicate spatial research, concepts, theories, or arguments to diverse audiences.</li>
         </ul>

      <div class="block">
         <h5>Course Materials</h5>
         <p>We will be learning about and analyzing interpretive planning and design through texts, visual media, and interactive media. Any required readings and media analyses should be completed before class. The full text of required readings as well as links to other required media will be posted on Canvas. Any recommended readings listed are for reference for your final projects.</p>

         <p>Our initial work in digital media will be done in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, which is a JavaScript-based framework for learning how to code in the context of the visual arts and design. In addition to Processing, we will learn to use a few other coding frameworks and libraries that will be introduced in the media workshops.</p> 

         <p>Computer programming relies upon the free and open sharing of knowledge and resources. The following free resources offer a wealth of material for beginners to programming:</p>

         <ul>
            <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> — the internet’s largest and most comprehensive Q&A site for programming.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> — coding tutorials.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> — coding tutorials.</li>

         <h5>Course Structure</h5>
         <p>Most of our class sessions will reflect a typical design studio format, with ample time devoted to project presentation and critique in both group and individual settings. Four of our class sessions will be devoted to media workshops, whereby you will learn the basic tools and techniques of digital media with the aim of using such media to distribute the intended effects of your projects more broadly and beyond the confines of the classroom. Thus the resulting skills learned in these workshops will be used to further your individual projects.</p>

         <p>Class sessions will be conducted entirely remotely this semester, with our live class sessions conducted via Zoom. While I will be remote and will not be in the classroom, you are welcome to attend class from the appointed classroom or you can attend class from the location of your choice. While in the classroom (and other public locations), please be sure to follow safe social distancing guidelines and to wear a face mask or face covering. Whether you are attending from the classroom or from another location, I ask that you access our class meetings by logging into Zoom from your personal computer and while using headphones; we will not be using the classroom NUFlex system for ADA/accessibility reasons. If you do not have access to a computer, please contact me.</p>

      <div class="block">
         <h5>Attendance</h5>
         <p>Class attendance is vital to learning. Attendance means more than being physically present. Rather, everyone is expected to be actively engaged in the work of the studio, which includes the timely completion of assignments, careful and thorough reading, participating in discussions, and providing constructive feedback to peers. Regular participation in our twice-weekly class sessions is important for progressing effectively in the course.</p>

         <p>If for any reason you are unable to attend a class, please contact me as soon as possible.</p>

         <h5>Course Communication</h5>
         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Slack</span></p>

         <p>To best facilitate communication, we will use a Slack workgroup for our class. Slack is a messaging app that makes it easy to send quick messages to anyone in the group, which means you can message your classmates as well as me. Our communications outside of the classroom will rely largely on Slack this semester. If you are new to Slack or need a refresher on how to use it, please view the Slack tutorial posted in the first module on Canvas.</p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Email</span></p>

         <p>While I am available by email, Slack is by far the best way to reach me. Please know that I aim to respond to emails within a 24-hour period (excluding weekends and holidays). Please include “[ARCH 7140]” or “[SUEN 7140]” in the subject of your email, which will allow your email to float to the top of my inbox.</p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Office Hours</span></p>

         <p>If you have a question or concern that requires more than a simple or straight-forward answer, please make an appointment to see me during my office hours, which are on Tuesdays 4:00-5:30 via Zoom. Please make a reservation for my office hours at <a href="https://calendly.com/jcephas/office-hours">https://calendly.com/jcephas/office-hours</a>. If you have a scheduling conflict during my office hours, message me through Slack and we can schedule an alternate time to meet.</p>

         <p>Please make note of the University’s policy for accommodating students with disabilities: “Northeastern University and the Disability Resource Center (DRC) are committed to providing disability services that enable students who qualify under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) to participate fully in the activities of the university. To receive accommodations through the DRC, students must provide appropriate documentation that demonstrates a current substantially limiting disability. Accommodations are provided based on an evaluation of the information provided by students and their clinicians, on a case-by-case basis. Students should provide documentation to the DRC at their earliest convenience to allow for sufficient time for review. After the documentation has been reviewed, a disability specialist will contact the student regarding appropriate next steps. Visit the DRC website at: <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/">http://www.northeastern.edu/drc/</a> for additional information or contact staff at 617-373-2675.”</p>

         <p>If you have documentation from DRC for course accommodations, please provide me with that documentation as soon as possible, ideally on the first day of class. If you suspect you may need accommodations for a disability or you suspect you may have an undiagnosed disability that might impact learning, please reach out to DRC as soon as possible.</p>
