			<h2>Precedent Research - The Amsterdam-Rhine Canal System</h2>

				<!--Analysis of the Netherlands Canal System-->

				<h3 class="organize">What is the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal?</h3>

					<p class="organize">
						The Amsterdam-Rhine Canal is Canal System in the Netherlands that runs from Amsterdam, the capital of the country and one of the largest ports, to the main shipping artery of the Rhine. This Canal System was completed in 1952 and is about 45 miles long, leading it to be one of the most heavily used Canal System in Western Europe. 
					</p>

				<h3 class="organize">Why is this important?</h3>
					<p class="organize">
						Well, besides being a huge transportation connection, the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal is used for water level reuglations in surrounding polders. When regulating water levels, minimizing flooding and managing available water resources between different stakeholders are both incredibly influential factors. By using the Canal for regulating water levels, they are able to ensure a sufficient volume of ground water and surface water, along with keeping the water quality up to par.
					</p>
				<h3 class="organize">Who Manages the Water?</h3>
					<p class="organize">
						Another great question! Water management in the Netherlands is divided into two main groups. The first is vested in the Rijkswaterstaat, which is essentially a public agency for water management. The Rijkwaterstaat focuses on maintaing dykes, dams, weirs, storm surge barriers, and other methods to address flooding. This may be done through projects such as "Room for Rivers" or the physical construction of secondary channels.
					</p>
					<p class="organize">
						The other group responsible for water management in the Netherlands are their District Water Boards. These local government organizations are responsible for the regional waters. The main focuses that fall under their jurisdiction include ensuring water is clean in order to keep fish stocks up, along with protecting from floods and making sure that farmers have enough water for their crops.
					</p>
				<h3 class="organize">Room for Rivers Program</h3>
					<p class="organize">
						Along with their water management system that is already in place, the Netherlands realizes that being prepared for climate change relies on being proactive and this lead to the creation of Room for Rivers. The main goal of the program is to manage higher water levels by lowering the levels of flood plains, creating water buffers, relocating levees, increasing the depths of side channels and the construction of side passses or secondary channels.
					</p>
					<p class="organize">
						The key is to restore the natural floodplain through 3 objectives:
						<ol type = "1" >
							<li>The Rhine will cope with 16,000 cubic meters of water per second without flooding</li>
							<li>The measures to increase safety will increase the overall environmental quality</li>
							<li>The extra room for rivers that will be needed will be made permanently available</li>
						</ol>
					</p>

			<h2>Precedent Research - The LA River</h2>

			<!--Analysis of the LA River-->

				<h3 class="organize">What is the LA River</h3>
					<p class="organize">
						The LA River naturally ran from the Santa Susana Mountains to the mouth of Long Beach making it around 51 miles long. However, in the 20th century, majors floods pushed the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers to channelize the river into what we see it as today. What we see today is a unnatural river that is heavily polluted from agriculture and urban runoff, but it is slowly transitioning into a river that will bring additional functions rather than just flood control. Many city groups and organizations are pushing for ideas that will address water quality, ecology, habitat, recreation, and open space issues.
