          <h1 style="text-align: center;">Community Engagement in East Boston</h1>
          <p style="text-align: center;">Community engagement typically plays one of the most crucial roles in the neighborhood planning process as planners and developers use feedback from the community to determine how to best plan and develop new policies and physical spaces tailored to the unique needs of the community. In East Boston, community engagement methods, which have been mostly unchanged for decades, have historically and consistently resulted in planning studies that have failed to gather the widespread and diverse engagement needed to make decisions based on the neighborhoods best interest. Language barriers, time constraints, complex information and travel requirements are just a part of a combination of obstacles which create an existing engagement process which is inequitable and inaccessible to many members of the community.</p>

          <p>Today, as we navigate a global pandemic, nationwide social movements, and an increasingly warming world, we must consider “how can we improve the physical and digital accessibility of public engagement methods and events for neighborhood planning initiatives in East Boston?”.</p>
          <p>The people of East Boston have exceptional opinions based on their personal and collective needs and we must explore and create new strategies for community engagement in order to understand how we can best serve the people of our neighborhood. Existing research and strategies have already been developed and deployed locally with institutions like Emerson College’s Engagement Lab, the City of Boston’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, and various private companies like coUrbanize. All share a common goal of increasing the effectiveness of community engagement and by analyzing this existing research and technology and adapting their uses to newly constructed theories I will be proposing a revolutionary new toolkit, combining both digital and physical engagement strategies, which can be used by public and private sectors to improve outreach numbers, promote diversity, and to ensure an equitable and accessible community engagement and planning process.</p>
