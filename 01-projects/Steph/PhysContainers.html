	<h2>PHYSICAL CONTAINERS</h2>
	<div class="box">
		<p>La Constelación will have two physical containers. One at a human scale - a pamphlet, and one at a planning scale - a guide to urban planning for undocumented immigrants. They both serve to work together and are under the same umbrella of urban planning taking into account the different stakeholders of this project. We can see this in effect with the interactive diagram to the right, that shows the larger network of the city to the perspective of a person holding the pamphlet.

	<h2>PAMPHLET</h2>
	<div class="box">
		<p>This is the human scale map of resources and contacts. The purpose of this pamphlet is to help undocumented immigrants know who, what and where the existing resources are within their city or neighborhood. It will contain the map of Network of Safety, Know Your Rights information, as well as current policies that East Boston is under that work against or in their favor. As well as a link to people and organizations that can help. This pamphlet will be distributed through safe locations in the community</p>

	<h2>GUIDE TO URBAN PLANNING FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS</h2>
<div class="box"> 
	<p>The safety of undocumented immigrants, lies in their invisibility. It may seem like the jurisdiction that lies on the fate of undocumented immigrants is that of national politics, but that is not the case. Subnational governments, policymakers, planners and communities can, and should, do more to secure their safety. Designers and urban planners can also play a big role in this - in designing a safe city. I will talk about a few theories about urban planning for undocumented immigrants that could be applied to the urban setting, using East Boston as a case study of possible application. I will also present suggestions to their translations into physical space.</p>
