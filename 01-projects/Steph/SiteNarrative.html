				<p>The extents of my site for the project is East Boston in general. The urban planning guide will present theories that have presented translations of theories in the case study of East Boston. The following maps give information on demographics of East Boston, their transportation network, and their current safety network. Through these mappings we can get a sense of where this safety is felt, what is missing and what can be combined to work together.</p>
				<p>The map on the left shows the relationship between Safety and Transportation, looking at walking distances of nearest places of safety that undocumented immigrants can potentially use in an emergency situation.</p>
