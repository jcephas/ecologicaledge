				<h2> SUMMARY </h2>
			<div class="box">
				<p>In a country founded by immigrants, the term "illegal" is unjust for undocumented people in the U.S. The nation's immigration system has made it almost impossible for people who are fleeing difficult situations or looking for better opportunities, to establish homes away from their origin countries. In East Boston and all over the nation, ICE arrests have been occuring more often and breaking the very sense that immigrants came in search for - <b>safety.</b> Despite East Boston delcaring itself a "sanctuary city," a simple policy has proven not to be enough in the protection of undocumented folks.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="box2">
				<p>How can sanctuary cities establish safety for<br>undocumented immigrants through design?</p>
			</div>

			<div class="box">
				<p>In order to create a sense of safety, there must be safe places for individuals. Through the use of community ties with leaders and organizations, safe locations, a series of mappings and case studies, a network of safety can be created in East Boston. We have more agency than we think we do. Undocumented immigrant rights should not be up to solely national government policy. We can do more - from Policymakers, to planners/designers, to even a community member - we can all do something more in the protection of undocumented folks. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) to create awareness on the unseen boundaries placed on undocumented folks on the daily, and (2) to propose a framework and guide that could break down these barriers and create a safer environment and community for immigrants.</p>

This diagram shows on what end each stakeholder lies within the positive / negative scale. Notice how, Designer & Policy Makers can have both. The order from inside to outside also shows the quantity of that impact in relation to the others.</p>-->

			<h2>SITE NARRATIVE</h2>
			<div class="short-box">
				<p>The extents of my site for the project is East Boston in general. The urban planning guide will present theories that have presented translations of theories in the case study of East Boston. The following maps give information on demographics of East Boston, their transportation network, and their current safety network. Through these mappings we can get a sense of where this safety is felt, what is missing and what can be combined to work together.</p>
				<p>The map below shows the relationship between Safety and Transportation, looking at walking distances of nearest places of safety that undocumented immigrants can potentially use in an emergency situation. We can also see in the detail bubble the active corridor that forms with the community centers and organizations present.</p>
