	<h1>Estableciendo Raíces: Planting Roots</h1>

	<h2>Project Background</h2>

	<p> <img src="Images/conceptdiag.png" style="float: left; margin: 50px"></p>

	<p>Many public space design processes neglect to involve users in the middle developmental phase, focusing mostly on initial thoughts or reactions on already designed parcels. In East Boston, developers often disregard community voices, through hard to attend meetings and a lack of accessible information (no translating options, incomprehensible technical visuals, etc).  The opinions of the community should not be seen as reactionary in the design process,  but rather innovative, as they provide a viewpoint that is closely aligned with a space’s need. </p>

	<p>An architect’s ultimate purpose is to create spaces for the user, and as such the main voices in the development of spatial design should be of those who inhabit the space. Spatial equity, especially in quickly developing urban centers like Boston, needs to become a priority. Minority communities are displaced by large waves of gentrification, and people are made to feel like they do not belong in spaces that they inhabit daily. Ensuring that people are intrinsically involved in development processes allows for the preservation and growth of communities.  </p>

	<p>Exploring the idea of belonging, this project looks to interact with East Boston residents to define the design and basis for a potential public space. The primary space of impact will be a BPDA owned parcel located west of the intersection of Condor and Putnam Streets. Primary stakeholders for this project will include Eagle Hill residents of all ages (as well as residents of the general East Boston area) particularly of an immigrant background and the BPDA. Using Participatory Action Research methods, such as photovoice, workshops, and data walks, the community will be engaged through ideation processes with the designer. This redefined design process will look to establish a sustainable cycle of collaboration that can be applied to a variety of public spaces and community projects.
