   	<p>In ecological analysis, <span class="highlight">the edge is a space of transition and definition</span>. Rather than a delineation, it is a space that is occupied and alive. In applying ecological principles to landscape planning and design, Richard Forman identified the edge not as a static line but rather something that is ever changing, <span class="highlight">a place where systems align, overlap, or are juxtaposed</span>. Otherwise known as the ecotone, this place where ecosystems (both urban and “natural”) meet each other functions as a third system that contains elements of the adjacent systems but with its own independent energies born from those conditions. Thus <span class="highlight">ecology thrives on diversity</span>; but diversity often also leads to instability.</p>

   	<p>The edge can also describe the plight of marginalized communities. In the United States, minority and immigrant populations in urban areas are often economically, physically, and socially isolated. The research on how these neighborhoods will be affected by climate change is still emerging, but the history of environmental injustice is foreboding.</p>

   	<p>This year-long research studio interrogates the <span class="highlight">intertwined issues of social justice and climate change</span> by analyzing the landscapes, communities, and histories of East Boston as a nearby example of where issues of equity and environment intersect. East Boston is subject to frequent flooding, on the edge of an industrial district and adjacent to Logan Airport. Its mean income is one of the lowest in Boston, but as the social and economic landscape of the city changes, its residents have justified concerns about its gentrification.</p>

   	<p>By the late nineteenth century, Boston had become a city of peninsulas, with East Boston stretching up to the north and accessible from the main peninsula by several bridges and accessible from other parts of the city by ferries.</p>

   	<p>In recent years, Boston has begun experiencing <span class="highlight">severe winter flooding</span> due to climate change. This flooding especially affects neighborhoods like East Boston that remain essentially unprotected from storm surges.</p>

   	<p>Yet the communities of East Boston have <span class="highlight">a long history of activism and resilience</span>. Extending back to the community opposition to the development of Logan Airport in the 1960s to current concerns around the development of an electrical substation, East Bostoners have rallied together as active and engaged residents, making their voices heard.</p>

   	<h5>The Project</h5>
   	<p>In response to these conditions, students were asked to <span class="highlight">uncover and make visible the multifaceted layers of the built, social, and ecological environments of East Boston</span>.  While the results of the students’ research and design should have spatial implications, we ultimately have been more interested in how they might synthesize knowledge across concerns in order to construct new lenses on the conceptions of sustainability and resilience.</p>

   	<p>Each student developed an individual project sited within East Boston that addressed issues initially identified during research undertaken during the fall semester. Using the framework of interpretive design, students have been charged with taking in-depth research about people and places and, <span class="highlight">rather than proposing a “solution” to a “problem,” focusing instead on channelling that research through a medium that can allow people to engage with the issues addressed in the research</span>.  In this framing, interpretive design is <span class="highlight">a project of provocation in that we have sought not to passively communicate information but to inspire people to action</span>. “Action” here is broadly defined—that action might range from explicit activism to simple engagement. In any case, it means moving people towards some specific and defined end.</p>

   	<p>The primary design outcome of the semester is a set of data containers for the research conducted in the fall: one physical container and one digital container. Together these two data containers aim to critically conserve and/or communicate aspects of culture, history, identity, environment, or memory in East Boston with the forms of these containers drawing from the issues explored during the research phase.
   	</p>

   	<p>Over the course of the semester, students have engaged in digital media workshops where they have learned how to conceptualize and build their digital data containers. <span class="highlight">In designing the physical and digital data containers, they have been asked to consider what data each container holds, and how these containers might share, collect, transmit, or transform that data</span>. The physical container might be a building, a landscape, a planning policy, an urban object, or something else entirely. The digital container might be a website, phone app, interactive map, or a database.</p>

		<p>Designing these containers has meant considering who they are for as well as who participates in their creation. Where are the data containers located and how do people access the information within them? What provocation do these data containers aim to instill? How do they support, amplify, or sustain some kind of action that people might take in relation to the issues to which the containers are responding?</p>
