	<h1>Estableciendo Raíces: Planting Roots</h1>

	<h2>Project Background</h2>
	<p>The current configuration of a typical architectural design process usually neglects to involve  its users until too late in the timeline, presenting mostly finished concepts in town halls or focus groups. In East Boston, developers have not considered and often disregard community voices, through hard to attend meetings and a lack of accessible information given (no translating options, incomprehensible technical visuals, etc).  The opinions of the community should not be seen as reactionary in the design process,  but rather innovative, as they provide a viewpoint that is closely aligned with a space’s need. </p>

	<h2>Project Stakeholders</h2>
	<p class="gentext"><img src="Images/Gomez-03-StakeholderStory-01.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 20px; width: 800px; height: 550px">
		An architect’s ultimate purpose is to create spaces for the user, and as such the main voices in the development of spatial design should be of those who inhabit the space. Spatial equity, especially in quickly developing urban centers like Boston, needs to become a priority. Minority communities are displaced by large waves of gentrification, and people are made to feel like they do not belong in spaces that they inhabit daily. Ensuring that people are intrinsically involved in development processes allows for the preservation and growth of communities. </p>
