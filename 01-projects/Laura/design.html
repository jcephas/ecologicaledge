		East Boston is a community built and known by immigrants. Throughout its history, the development of community spaces and connections has been led by the residents of Eastie. A small and walkable neighborhood, it provides a welcoming and open invitation for community interaction and growth. However, a lot of the growth is largely confined to one area, defined by the squares. The transportation and community organization systems provide ways in which these opportunities could be expanded further and made more readily available to other areas of Eastie.

	<p>Currently, the majority of activity in East Boston takes place in the Urban Squares: Maverick, Central, and Day. These spaces are hubs for transportation, commercial activity, and neighborhood connections. However, the existing squares leave out large areas of the neighborhood disconnected. These areas of opportunity could help further expand the community roots in different areas of Eastie, and create a productive network.  </p>

	<h2 style="display: block">Intervention Site</h2>

	<p> <img src="Images/closeupsite.png" style= "width:859px; height: 503px;display: inline"></p>

	<p>The area of Eagle Hill is largely residential, and home to most of the Latinx demographic in East Boston. The Chelsea Creek borders Eagle Hill on the north, providing water connection and views into Chelsea, MA. However, right now this is not a destination, even for current Eastie residents. The connection to the water is fractured by largely fenced-off industrial sites, but small glimpses like the Urban Wild Park shows what might be possible. </p>

	<p>The site located at approximately 102-168 Condor Street, and Condor Street as a whole, provide an exciting opportunit for expanding the Urban Square network in East Boston. Through a combination of commercial corridors that fall just shy of the area, and established community assets like East Boston High School, as well as the direct connection to Chelsea Creek, the site has been identified by the community as a potential space for community development. 
	</p>

	<p>Coincidentally, GreenRoots, a community group based in Chelsea, is working closely with East Boston residents to brainstorm ideas on how to better develop this site. This project is aiming to connect into these ongoing efforts to hopefully provide the services and research that is wanted as this initiative continues. </p>

	<p><img src="Images/luxaptmap.png" style="width: 50%;"></p>

	<p>Based on resident feedback, both in interviews and larger analyses made by additional sources, gentrification is the largest issue looming over the East Boston community. The effects of gentrification are widely known, and have been studied in depth both in the design and sociological fields. As an addition to the existing research, this project looks to gentrification trends in East Boston as a way to map a Matrix of Belonging. This matrix is defined in three parts: Materiality, Scale, and Form. These characteristics have been flagged by residents as points of discomfort, worry, and concern. In an attempt to avoid the negative effects of new development, a parallel matrix is created to show Materiality, Scale, and Form that incites comfort and belonging. </p>
