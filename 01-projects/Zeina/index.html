	<h2>The inhabitants of East Boston face the consequences of the constant exposure to multiple flows of pollution. The impacts of industry and pollution are compounded over time in organic matter. It is important to address the harsh divide between the Industrial and the Ecological to bridge the gap between those spaces. “[W]hat are urban + landscaping strategies to mitigate the effects of pollution in air, soil, and water?” Prioritizing the creation of a framework that addresses how industries act as stressors in the community and ecologies to design strategies that are mutually beneficial for individuals and ecology.
	I will collect site samples from specific locations and display the samples in a wunderkammer styled installation. The display will act as a material analysis to understand the individual factors that impact East Boston’s ecologies and inhabitants.  Existing data from previous EPA data sets will be juxtaposed with self-composed data collection such as pH definition and air pollutants. This citizen science method will allow for a deeper interaction with the existing community for scientific research. Analyzing the data along with relevant precedents would provide a framework to discuss how existing strategies behave and what issues they face today. The data poses as the foundation for mapping the pollution, and important sites. It is critically important that integrated deployment of successful strategies be used to ensure a system that works as a whole.
	By developing a deployable strategy to address the issues East Boston faces in regards to pollutants, and external stressors (i.e. gentrification and climate change), the communities can initiate these elements as needed through phasing as a guide to address their needs. These strategies include designed landscapes (native planting, habitation) and architectural infra/structures to address and accommodate for growth and development of these existing communities. This will work in conjunction with an online platform that shares information, and allows East Boston residents to input their own data.

	<li> Ecologies</li>
	<li> Industries</li>

<h3>This space is designed for East Bostonians + Policy Makers in the area. This online container will act as an archive to news, data and information regarding industry and pollutants in the environment. It is essential that the information is easy to access and is understandable to the general audiences. Infographics will soon be provided with information and statistics on pollution levels in the area.  </h3></div>
