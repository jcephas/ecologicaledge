			<h2> Abstract </h2>
		<div>
			<p>In a country founded by immigrants, the term "illegal" is unjust for undocumented people in the U.S. The nation's immigration system has made it almost impossible for people who are fleeing difficult situations or looking for better opportunities, to establish homes away from their origin countries. In East Boston and all over the nation, ICE arrests have been occuring more often and breaking the very sense that immigrants came in search for - safety. Despite East Boston declaring itself a "sanctuary city," a simple policy has proven not to b e enough in the protection of undocumented folks.</p>

			<p>How can sanctuary cities establish safety for undocumented immigrants through design?</p>

			<p>In order to create a sense of safety, there must be safe places for individuals. Through the use of community ties with leaders and organizations, safe locations, a series of mappings and case studies, a network of safety will be created along Bennington Street in East Boston. Extending this corridor of community organizations and lively concentration of local activity will benefit and connect a gap between the other nodes of Sensitive Locations all throughout East Boston.<br>The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) to create awareness on the unseen boundaries placed on undocumented folks on the daily, and (2) to propose a framework that could break down these barriers and create a safer environment and community for immigrants.</p>
