	<h2>Urban Planning for Undocumented Immigrants</h2>
<div class="box"> 
	<p>The safety of undocumented immigrants, lies in their invisibility. It may seem like the jurisdiction that lies on the fate of undocumented immigrants is that of national politics, but that is not the case. Subnational governments, policymakers, planners and communities can, and should, do more to secure their safety. Designers and urban planners can also play a big role in this - in designing a safe city. I will talk about a few theories about urban planning for undocumented immigrants that could be applied to the urban setting, using East Boston as a case study of possible application.</p>
