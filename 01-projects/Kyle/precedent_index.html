						The Amsterdam-Rhine Canal is Canal System in the Netherlands that runs from Amsterdam, the capital of the country and one of the largest ports, to the main shipping artery of the Rhine. This Canal System was completed in 1952 and is about 45 miles long, leading it to be one of the most heavily used Canal System in Western Europe.

				<h3 style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top:330px"class="organize">Why is this important?</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top: 370px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						Well, besides being a huge transportation connection, the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal is used for water level regulations in surrounding polders. When regulating water levels, minimizing flooding and managing available water resources between different stakeholders are both incredibly influential factors. By using the Canal for regulating water levels, they are able to ensure a sufficient volume of ground water and surface water, along with keeping the water quality up to par.
					</p>
				<h3 style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 130px; margin-top:450px" class="organize">Who Manages the Water?</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 130px; margin-top: 490px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						Another great question! Water management in the Netherlands is divided into two main groups. The first is vested in the Rijkswaterstaat, which is essentially a public agency for water management. The Rijkwaterstaat focuses on maintaing dykes, dams, weirs, storm surge barriers, and other methods to address flooding. This may be done through projects such as "Room for Rivers" or the physical construction of secondary channels.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 130px; margin-top: 680px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						The other group responsible for water management in the Netherlands are their District Water Boards. These local government organizations are responsible for the regional waters. The main focuses that fall under their jurisdiction include ensuring water is clean in order to keep fish stocks up, along with protecting from floods and making sure that farmers have enough water for their crops.
					</p>
				<h3 h3 style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top:640px" class="organize">Room for Rivers Program</h3>
					<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top: 670px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						Along with their water management system that is already in place, the Netherlands realizes that being prepared for climate change relies on being proactive and this lead to the creation of Room for Rivers. The main goal of the program is to manage higher water levels by lowering the levels of flood plains, creating water buffers, relocating levees, increasing the depths of side channels and the construction of side passses or secondary channels.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top: 850px;width: 400px" lass="organize">
						The key is to restore the natural floodplain through 3 objectives:
						<ol style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 880px; margin-top: 900px;width: 400px" type = "1" >
							<li>The Rhine will cope with 16,000 cubic meters of water per second without flooding</li>
							<li>The measures to increase safety will increase the overall environmental quality</li>
							<li>The extra room for rivers that will be needed will be made permanently available</li>
						</ol>

					<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 130px; margin-top: 970px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						The LA River naturally ran from the Santa Susana Mountains to the mouth of Long Beach making it around 51 miles long. However, in the 20th century, majors floods pushed the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers to channelize the river into what we see it as today. What we see today is a unnatural river that is heavily polluted from agriculture and urban runoff, but it is slowly transitioning into a river that will bring additional functions rather than just flood control. Many city groups and organizations are pushing for ideas that will address water quality, ecology, habitat, recreation, and open space issues. 
					</p>

				<h3 style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top:1050px"class="organize">Why is this important?</h3>

				<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top: 1100px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						It was orginally designed for the single use condition of providing flood control, while the 99% of the time, it provides additional uses without compromising its function. The revitalization of  the river would show that 95% of the time, the river's functions would be centered around water retention, water quality, ecosystems services, programming and recreation.
					</p>

				<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 900px; margin-top: 1250px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						Having a healthy ecosystem creates a mosaic of native plants and animal communities, which help eachother survive and supports the health and well being of humans by cleaning air and water, and absorbing carbon. The availability of open space is closely tied to the health and social quity, and many areas within the the LA River basin are confront with the inequitable distribution of parks.
					</p>


				<h3 style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 130px; margin-top:1250px" class="organize">What Will It Do?</h3>

				<p style="text-align: left; position: absolute; margin-left: 130px; margin-top: 1300px;width: 400px" class="organize">
						One of the main focuses of the LA River is on equitable access and transportation to the river, which would include regional transit such as bus routes, trainlines, freeways and bikeways. It would also present the opportunity for eco-transit to develop in the green corridor to connect to multiple communities. To tackle greenhouse gases, they are focusing on reducing loads, system optimization and renewable energy substitution. Another aspect is focused on having year round programming to unite the region through safe access, education and arts/culture, as well as sports and recreation.
