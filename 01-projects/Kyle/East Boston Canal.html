		<h1>East Boston Canal Proposal</h1>

			<h2 >Project Summary </h2>
				
				<!--Abstract-->
				<img class="organize"; src="https://www.sasaki.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ClimateReadyBoston_Page_10_large-1000x608.jpg"; style="width: 400px; height: 270px; float: right; opacity: .8;border: 5px solid #555">

					Today, cities are facing a multitude of issues spanning from social justice movements to the rising sea levels caused by climate change. These issues are forcing cities to rethink how urban centers are designed and how these new approaches will affect the majority of residents living within the city limits. Challenges such as housing equity and allowing for new private development to take place puts pressure on finding a balance between the two and climate change forces cities to take drastic measures to prepare for flooding and any displacement it may bring. In East Boston, the controversial redevelopment of Suffolk Downs exemplifies these scenarios by bringing in expensive housing units and the promise of resilient open space.

					This proposal analyzes the effects that large Green Resilient Infrastructure Systems (GRIS) have on urban communities and how effective they are at adapting to the consequences of climate change. The concept of Green Resilient Infrastructure is to provide environmental management benefits to the area along with increasing the neighborhood attractiveness. As cities embrace resilience strategies (rain gardens, greenways, reintroduced marshland), it has been correlated with increasing the property value of the surrounding land leading to indirect displacement of low income and minority neighborhoods, which are disproportionately affected by climate change.

					To address and hopefully avoid the issues of indirect displacement, research has influenced my decisions to focus on a design intervention in East Boston, focusing on three areas; Central Square, Logan Airport and Jefferies Point. The stakeholders for this project is a long list, but mainly consists of Environmental Justice organizations, the City of Boston, local institutions and universities, development firms,  field experts such as environmental scientists, non-profit organizations such as N.O.A.H, and Landscape Architecture / Urban Planning firms. 


					This design intervention will focus on understanding the environmental history of East Boston and how restoring certain attributes may offer an alternative method to adapt to climate change and protect residents from sea level rise, while ensuring indirect displacement is kept to a minimum. While Boston continues to move forward with their Climate Ready Boston Action Plan, I hope to synthesize alternative plans to restore ecological function in the Logan Airport District, Central Square and portions of Jefferies Point.

				<h3 class="organize">What Does This All Mean?</h3>
				<p class="organize">
					Sea Level Rise in East Boston is something that is recognized by the City as a natural hazard that needs to be addressed. In the first image, we can see the areas where water will be infilitrating the neighborhood and truly where the critical areas of intervention are. Through the analysis of these conditions and the other conditions presented, we can begin to understand the most effective methods for climate adaptation.

					In the next image, we see a dot map that represents the racial density in East Boston in relation to the projected Sea-Level Rise (SLR). Climate change is a natural phenomenon that is affecting everyone globally, however marginalized communities who are often contributing less to climate change, see the brunt of it all. East Boston has an approximate total of 45,000 residents of which 58% are Hispanic, 32% are White, 4% are Asian and 2% are Black. Understanding these numbers is incredibly important when planning for climate adaptation to avoid displacement of the community we are trying to protect.
				</p>
				<p class="organize">
					The next set of images are focused on the project area running from Jefferies Point to the Airport. In this analysis, GIS data has been used to get a better understanding of the elevation profile, tree density, where sea level rise will be occuring, and how developed land will be affected. The elevation profile may not seem like an important piece to understand, but being able to see the topography can help point us in a direction where we can use the natural flow, guiding us in the planning of the East Boston Canal System. Tree Density is another critical piece of information because every single tree that is planted helps us develop stormwater management infrastructure.
